The files in this folder accomplish this role

Here all the functions needed to be implemented are listed. If some of those functions are by accident not in this list, you will recieve a linker error when trying to compile the frontend

window_split_screen_layout.hpp:
- `unsigned int max_rows() const;`
- `unsigned int max_columns() const;`
